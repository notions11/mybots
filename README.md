## 1D creature morphologies
For this assignment, I created randomly generated snakes with a random # of body components from 5-10. These body components each had randomly selected sizes from 0-1 for all three of its dimensions (x, y, and z). In addition, the joint axes were randomly chosen from a set of (0 0 1, 0 1 0, 1 0 0). As per the assignment instructions, links with sensors are colored green, and the ones without are colored blue. The decision as to whether a link was a sensor or not was up to a 50/50 coin flip.

## Run the Code
After downloading all the code, run the file named **main.py**. This will essentially run search.py and the rest of the code to run the simulation. You can also change the variables in constants.py to modify things such as the number of generations
